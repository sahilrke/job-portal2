Students logging should be able to upload their information in the form of a CV. The key feature of this project is that, it is a onetime registration. It provides the facility of maintaining the details of the students. It also provides a requested list of candidates to recruit the students based on given query. This project will aid colleges to practice full IT deployment.

This will also help in fast access procedures in placement related activities. The users can access easily to this and the data can be retrieved easily in no time. A registered student can directly login using user name and password, submit resume. In the student registration form, we can give personal details, educational qualifications, and professional skills and upload resume.

The job details of the placed students will be provided by the administrator. The administrator plays an important role in our project. They provide approval of student registration and updating.
